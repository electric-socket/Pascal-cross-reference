(*         Cross reference generator Version 2.10, 8/23/86
          ------> REQUIRES TURBO PASCAL 3.0 <------
     *************************************************************
  This program, in its original form, was downloaded off of some bulletin
  board somewhere.  At that point, it only listed a Pascal program to the
  LST device and generated a cross reference of whatever reserved words
  were in the list in function rsvdword, with those reserved boldfaced in
  the printout.  I have made numerous improvements.

  The program now optionally lists include files within the source listing.
  At any point during listing, printing may be interrupted by pressing any
  key, at which point you can either resume the listing or abort.
  The listing can be sent to the printer, the screen, or a disk file.
  If sent to the screen, reserved appear in reverse video.  If output is
  to the printer or a file, the screen displays the name of the file being
  listed, with include files indented, and the line number of output.
  File names supplied by the user, i.e. the file to be listed and optional
  output file, are checked by function Exist , which is cool in that
  it does not need to open the file.  In fact, there are several subroutines
  within this program which would be useful for general purpose TURBO Pascal
  programming.

  You should note that many of the new functions of XREF use TURBO features
  which are specific to the IBM-PC version, such as the reverse video and
  use of wherex and wherey.

  I can't think of anything else one would need in a source listing program.

  I can and I am not familiar with mailing updates of programs or ideas across
  country either. So I have modified this program and willing to share it with
  you. If you could get the program one BBS closer great.

* No longer will you have to deal with blank pages or lines of text wrapping
  around making your programs listings hard to read. With this version of
  XREF chars per line is auto sized on a page by page basis. You can spool
  off odd and even pages to files. So what you say why not print the odd
  pages tear off the paper feed it back in with the blank side up and print
  the even pages, and presto a book.

  This program works with Gemini 10X and any compatible printer. The codes
  are stored in constants contained in  the file printer.cst, so as to be
  easily changeable for any printer with this capacity. There are three
  basic ways to invoke the program:

             1) XREF from command line.  You will be prompted for everything.
             2) XREF [pathname][File_Name].[ext]
                       You will be prompted for all applicable parameters.
             3) XREF [pathname][File_Name].[ext] [/ { B,C,D,E,F,I,N,O,S,T } ]
               *B means delete back up versions of source files.
               *C means compressed more than one procedure per page if
                  they both fit on page
               *D means double strike printing
               *E means spool even pages to disk to print later
                  File_Spec.EVE
                F means print out to disk file
                I means list include files within the main
               *M means output only modified files eg ones with backup files
                N means include the cross reference
               *O means spool odd pages to disk to print later  File_Spec.ODD
                S means send output to the screen instead of printer.
               *T means top down program listing valid only with switch I
                  the original way bottom up sucks and I claim no responsibility
                  for it. I recommend top down listing.
           4) future features for those who need ideas
                rewrite reserve word so that it returns an index
                 this would allow you to check for var const for local vars
                 they would not take up memory on big programs or clog xref listing
                keep track of procedure depth and include nesting level in print
                 out listing
                add pretty print feature to just rewrite file with enhancements
                  like upper/lower case reserved words
                  first letters in vars capitalized
                  matching begin end comments
                  var declarations aligned
              * auto size for page if no line exceeds 80 chars then set
                  cpl to 80 else 96 else 136
              * add no new page if both procedures or more fit on same page
                ADD GATHER FILES FUNCTION THAT WILL MOVE ALL THE FILES TO
                  ONE DIRECTORY AND REMOVE DIRECTORIES FROM INCLUDED
                  STATEMENTS
                Add xref all files in a directory modified after
                  a certain date.
                Add feature to omit library procedures in print outs
                    this would reduce the amount of printing.
******************************************************************************
  Note that the recursive nature of the actual listing procedure (do_listing)
  allows for any nesting level of INCLUDEs, even though TURBO Pascal does not
  allow INCLUDEs to be nested.  So this is nice, but of questionable value.
* you can create list files that are nothing more than a file of included
  statements for dealing with a subject rather than programing order

  The program requires TURBO 3.0 because it uses TURBO FIBs, which have been
  altered for version 3.0.  The FIB no longer contains the file's date of
  creation, so the file handle is passed to DOS function call $57, which
  returns the date.

  When I first use this code it was great. But then my programs were only 10
  or 15 pages. now just this program is 35 + pages and I am currently working
  on a terminal program that is 200 + pages that is 200 blank pages since you
  can't print on both sides, that is until now!

  The above asterisked features and modular breakdown enhancements have
  been add by

  If you find this program of value and wish to contribute to my
  college education it will be appreciated. Please feel free to
  share this program with other people.
