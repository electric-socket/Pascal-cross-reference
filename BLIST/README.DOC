BList is a Turbo Pascal Source Code lister and BEGIN/END Counter
program.  It can print a listing to Console or Printer, with
optional begin/end, case/end, and record/end counter.  It was
initially published in the Aug./Sept. issue of TUG Lines.

BLISTCPM.PAS is for CP/M-80 because the program
looks for a parameter passed by CP/M at absolute location $80.

BLIST.PAS is for MS-DOS, and has the following declarations changed 
in the GET_IN_FILE procedure:

Var FNam: String[14];
    Parm: String[14] Absolute CSeg:$0081;
    ParmLth: Byte Absolute CSeg:$0080;
    Existing: Boolean;
