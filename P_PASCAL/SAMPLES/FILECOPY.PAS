PROGRAM File_copy(prd, prr);

  with "prr" and "prd" in their path names, either as
  suffixes (.prr, .prd), prefixes, or entire names. If
  you plan to copy long files with this program, or you
  do not want to view the copied file as it is copied,
  put comment markers around the `WRITE(current);' and
  `WRITELN;' statements. }
