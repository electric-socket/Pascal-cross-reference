Name 		Type & Description
Character	Typically a single octet (one byte). This is an integer type.
Integer		The most natural size of integer for the machine.
Real		A single-precision floating point value.
Boolean		Specifies true or false logical values. This is also an integer type.
Enumerated	Specifies a user-defined list.
Subrange	Represents variables, whose values lie within a range.
String		Stores an array of characters.

Operator 	Description 				
and 		Called Boolean AND operator. If both 
		the operands are true, then condition
		becomes true. 	
and_then 	It is similar to the AND operator, 
		however, it guarantees the order in 
		which the compiler evaluates the 
		logical expression. Left to right 
		and the right operands are evaluated 
		only when necessary. 	(A and then B) is false.
or 		Called Boolean OR Operator. If any of 
		the two operands is true, then condition 
		becomes true. 	(A or B) is true.
or_else 	It is similar to Boolean OR, however, it 
		guarantees the order in which the compiler 
		evaluates the logical expression. Left to
		right and the right operands are evaluated 
		only when necessary. 	(A or else B) is true.
not 		Called Boolean NOT Operator. Used to reverse 
		the logical state of its operand. If a condition 
		is true, then Logical NOT operator will make 
		it false. 	not (A and B) is true.
Bit Operators

Bitwise operators work on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. All these operators work on integer operands and produces integer results. The truth table for bitwise and (&), bitwise or (|), and bitwise not (~) are as follows âˆ’
p 	q 	p & q 	p | q 	~p 	~q
0 	0 	0 	0 	1 	1
0 	1 	0 	1 	1 	0
1 	1 	1 	1 	0 	0
1 	0 	0 	1 	0 	1

Delphi, Lazarus reserved words, keywords detailed explanation

Blogs from oranges, in case, and other places

Reserved words: identifiers such as variables can be reused;

Keywords: have specific meaning and cannot be redefined;

Modifiers: functions similar to reserved words, which means that they can be reused;

Data type: The data type is similar to reserved words, and generally do not redefine;

Prompt word: This information is used to prompt the user for platform dependency and other purposes during compilation, and should not be changed.

But try not to redefine reserved words, such as the following code

procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);

var true:string;

begin

end;

Can be executed correctly.

The same identifier is similar to a reserved word, the following program can also be executed:

type  Integer= Char;

var  I: Integer;

begin  I:= 'A';
  ShowMessage(I);end;

But the following program will report an error.

type string = Integer;

Therefore, it is best not to redefine the reserved words, identifiers, keywords, and modifiers;

unimplemented 


The following is a detailed explanation of each reserved word and keyword

======================================================

absolute   // It enables you to create a new variable, and the starting address of the variable is the same as another variable.

abstract //It allows you to create abstract methods, including classes with abstract methods called abstract classes.

Abstract   // keyword must be used with Virtual or Dynamic keyword at the same time, because abstract methods must be overridden.
           // Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, abstract methods cannot contain method bodies.

and //1. means logical and
    //2. represents bit operation

Array //Array is used to represent an array, any object can be declared as an array. Arrays are divided into two types: static and dynamic.
      //Static array
      //Dynamic array, because the number of elements is unknown at the time of declaration, you must use the SetLength method to set the size of the array later

as    //As is used to transform one object into another
      //For the conversion of the object filling interface, As must be used

asm  //Asm keyword is used to insert assembly code. When using assembly code, you must use the structure of asm...end; instead of begin...end;

assembler //Assembler keyword is used to support early assembly, such as 80386.

automated //Automated access specifier is used to describe the members of an automatic type, which can make the version of the program backward compatible.

begin //begin keyword is used to indicate the beginning of a program or a structure, and the end keyword must be used to end.

case //Case statement is used to complete the condition selection. The selected object of the Case statement must be an ordered type, including integer types, enumeration types, character types, etc.

cdecl //Cdecl is a type of function calling convention, which specifies the rules that must be followed when calling functions from a DLL written in C or C++.

class //Class keyword is used to declare or inherit a class, or to make the class and interface inherit at the same time.

const //Const keyword is used to declare constants, and the data declared with const cannot be changed in the program.

constructor //constructor keyword is used to declare the constructor of a class. When the class is instantiated, this function is called first

//The constructor is generally represented by Create, and the Create method can be associated with the CreateWnd method that exists in the class.

type

  ClassDemo = class(TObject)

    private

      fValue: Integer;

    public

      constructor Create;

  end;

constructor ClassDemo.Create;

begin

  fValue := 0;

end;

The contains//Contains keyword indicates whether a certain package (Package) contains a certain file.

//Files imported with Contains must be added to the package file, it can avoid losing references to key files.

package DATAX;

  requires

    rtl, clx;

  contains

    Db, DBLocal, DBXpress;

end.

The default//Default keyword is used to indicate the default value of an attribute

//Only attributes of ordered types allow the existence of default values, otherwise the attribute value must be initialized in the constructor.

type

  ClassDemo = class

    private

      fValue: Integer;

    published

      property Value: Integer read fValue write fValue default 0;

  end;

//It can also indicate the default attributes of a class

property strings[Index: Integer]: string read GetString write PutString; Default;

destructor //Destructor is used to identify the destructor, which is automatically called when the class is released.

dispid //DispId keyword is used in the DispInterface interface to specify a specific adaptation sequence number.

dispinterface //DispInterface is used to declare a specific adapter interface, which can accept incoming and outgoing data from the standard system interface.

div //Div is used to find the integer quotient of two numbers. The two values â€‹â€‹used for Div operation must both be of integer type, and the result of the operation must also be of integer type.

do //Do keyword is used in For, While, On, With statements to form a specific structure

downto //DownTo keyword is used in the For statement to indicate that the loop variable is decrementing.

for i := 100 downto 1 do

  ListBox1.Items.Add(IntToStr(i));

//In the For statement, the To keyword is used to increase the loop variable, and the DownTo keyword is used to decrease it.

dynamic//Dynamic is used to declare a dynamic method,

//Dynamic methods can be overridden, and the code size can be reduced as much as possible (different from Virtual).

procedure X(i: Integer); dynamic;

else//else is used to guide the running direction of the program. It can be used in conjunction with If, Case and On statements. When the condition is not met, it will run under else

//If statement (in If statement, semicolon is not allowed before else):

if a > b then

  c := a

else

  c:=b;

//Case statement:

case Tag Of

  1:Result:=1;

  2:Result:=2;

  3:Result:=3;

else

  Result:=0;

end;

//On statement (exception handling):

try

  i := StrToInt(s);

Excpet

  on EZeroDivide do Result := 1;

  on EOverflow do Result := 2;

else

  Result := 0;

end;

end//End is used to end a statement block or a unit.

//It can match begin, Case, Class, Interface, Asm, Unit, Package, etc.

//For statement blocks (partial end), a semicolon must be added after End.

//For units or packages (global end), a period must be added after end.

//It is not allowed to add symbols after End before the else keyword in the If statement.

procedure X;

begin

ã€€with Button1 do

ã€€begin

ã€€ã€€if Button1.ShowHint then

ã€€ã€€ã€€Button1.Caption :='Hinted'

ã€€ã€€else

ã€€end;

end;

//Use End in the package to end:

package DATAX;

  requires

    rtl,

    clx;

  contains Db, DBLocal, DBXpress;

end.

The except//except keyword is used for exception handling and must be used in a try statement. If an exception occurs, the statement after except is executed

try

  i := StrToInt(s);

except

  ShowMessage('Error!');

end;

export//Export indicates the function call contract, indicating that the function can be exported, and the exported function can be called locally or remotely.

//Other programs can call functions in the program in the form of dll. It is backward compatible.

function Add(a,b: Integer): Integer; export;

//If this program is compiled as Demo.exe, and another program needs to call this function, you can use the following statement

function Add(a,b: Integer): Integer; stdcall; external 'Demo.exe';

exports//exports is used to export objects, it must be used between the interface and the implementation, multiple items can be exported at the same time, and the items are separated by commas.

library Demo;

function X(i: Integer): string; stdcall;

begin

ã€€Result:=IntToStr(i);

end;

exports

ã€€X;

end;

function X(s: string): Integer; overload; stdcall;

begin

ã€€Result := StrToInt(s);

end;

exports

  X(i: Integer) name 'x1',

  X(s: string) name 'x2';

begin

end.

The external//External keyword is used to refer to an external or OBJ method.

{$L Demo.OBJ}

procedure X(i:Integer);external;

//If it is referenced from a dll or an external program, you can use the following code:

function A(FileName: string): string; external 'Demo.dll';

//If the referenced function is overloaded, you must additionally indicate the referenced name.

function A(Name: string): string; overload; stdcall; external 'Demo.dll' name 'A1';

function A(Code: Integer): string; overload; stdcall; external 'Demo.dll' name 'A2';

//When using the External keyword, you must pay attention to the case, otherwise an error will occur.

far//Far indicates the function call contract, indicating that the function can be called remotely.

//Other programs can call functions in the program in the form of dll. It is backward compatible.

function Add(a,b: Integer): Integer; Far;

//If this program is compiled into Demo.exe, and another program on another computer needs to call this function, you can use the following statement:

function Add(a,b: Integer): Integer; stdcall; external 'Demo.exe';

The file//File keyword indicates the type of file operation, the file must be declared as File,

//If you append Of and file type after File, the file can be defined to read and write data of the specified type.

type

  TPerson = record

    PName: string[32];

    PAge: Integer;

  end;

var

  PFile: file of TPerson;

The finalization//finalization keyword identifies the method to be called when the unit is released.

//Usually release objects that cannot be automatically released in the unit, or not.

//The most common case of finalization is to deinitialize OLE objects.

initialization

  ActiveX.OleInitialize(nil);

finalization

  ActiveX.OleUninitialize;

The finally//finally keyword points out the last method that must be called in exception handling.

//Regardless of whether an exception occurs, the statement after the finally is always executed at the end of the try statement.

try

  Node := Node.GetNext;

  Edit1.Text := Node.Text;

finally

ã€€Node := nil;

end;

The for//For keyword leads to the For loop structure, which is used to loop a specified number of times.

for i := 1 to 100 do sum := sum + i;

//If the loop variable is decreasing, you can use the DownTo keyword

for i := 100 downto 1 do Inc(sum);

The forward//Forward keyword is used to pre-define a method. Only define the method declaration, and then implement the method at the back of the program.

//This is conducive to the readability of the code, you can put all the declarations together, and then put all the implementations together.

function X(i: Integer): Integer; forward;

procedure Y(s: string); forward;

...

function X;

begin

  Result := i * 2;

end;

procedure Y;

begin

  WriteLn(s);

end;

//The method of forward declaration does not need to enter the method parameters and return value when implementing it, just use the method name directly.

function//Function is used to declare functions

function X(i: Integer): Integer;

//It can also be used for the declaration of dynamic functions

type

ã€€TFun = function(i: Integer): Integer of object;

//Dynamic declaration, you don't need to indicate the function name, just indicate the parameters and return type. The specific function name can be bound later.

goto//Goto statement is used to jump line number, you can jump to any position in the current structure layer.

//The label keyword must be used to declare the line number in the declaration.

//Because the Goto statement will destroy the structure of the program, it is not recommended.

var

ã€€a,b: Integer;

label

ã€€X,Y;

begin

ã€€if a> b then

The name//Name keyword is used to indicate the alias of the method,

//For a method to be externally referenced, it is recommended to use Name to apply for a method alias to avoid external programs from changing the entity content of the method.

//When referencing a method from outside, if the method has an alias, it must be identified by Name.

function MessageBox(HWnd: Integer; Text, Caption: PChar; Flags: Integer): Integer;

Near//Near indicates the function call contract, indicating that the function can be called locally.

//Other programs can call functions in the program in the form of dll. It is backward compatible.

function Add(a,b: Integer): Integer; near;

//If this program is compiled into Demo.exe, and another local program needs to call this function, you can use the following statement:

//From the above example, the Value in TClassA has a default value of 0,

//TClassB inherits TClassA, so it also inherits its default value, here use NoDefault to remove the default value

not//Not is used to negate, it negates the original result. For example:

if a > b then

//can be written as:

if not(a < b) then

//Not keyword is usually used to switch Boolean attributes

procedure Button1Click(Sender: TObject);

begin

ã€€StatusBar1.Visible := not StatusBar1.Visible;

object//Object is used to declare an object, which can be arbitrary and backward compatible. Object can only be inherited by Object.

//The method of declaring an object is the same as the method of declaring a class.

type

ã€€ODemoA = object

ã€€TMyProc = procedure(s: string) of object;

//The function or procedure declared by object can be dynamically bound to the specified function body, or bound to the control event.

The of//Of key is used to form a specified structure with other keywords. Of can be used with Case, Class, Array, File, Set, Object.

//Case statement:

case Tag Of

ã€€0: Result :='a';

or//1. means logical or

if (a>0) or (b>0) then

//2. represents bit operation

var

  a,b,c: Integer;

begin

  c := (a or b);

end;

//When using Or to represent logic, the expressions around Or must be enclosed in parentheses to avoid conflicting conditions

//If Or is used in the conditional statement, the editor does not know what the user does with Or

E.g:

if a>0 or b>0 then

//The compiler may understand as:

if a>(0 or b)>0 then

//or

if (a>0) or (b>0) then

//But when actually compiling, the compiler will generate a conflict and report an error

//And the first form may contain a>b>c, which is not supported in Delphi

//So you must use parentheses when using the Or operator to distinguish between left and right conditions.

//It means that you must also add parentheses when performing bitwise operations, enclose Or and the left and right parameters.

The out//Out keyword explains the output method of the method parameters. General functions can only have one return value.

//Use Out to return multiple results in one function.

//Out is different from var. Out is a parameter return in the form of a return value, while var is the address of a parameter directly input.

The overload//Overload keyword points out the method used for overloading, overloading means that the method name is the same,

//But the number, type or order of parameters are different, and the components that meet this condition are overloaded.

function X(i: Integer): string; overload;

function X(s: string): string; overload;

//When inheriting from the parent class, if the child class has the same method as the parent class, then overload must also be used to constitute an overload.

//But this type of overload must also meet the requirements of the overload.

type

ã€€end;

//As in the above example, the methods owned by the subclass are:

procedure CreateWnd; {inherited from parent class}

procedure CreateWnd(AOwner: TWinControl); {Subclass declaration}

//A total of two CreateWnd methods.

//If overloading is not used, the method of the parent class can be overridden in the subclass.

override//Override is used to override a method in Virtual or Dynamic form.

//The declaration of the overridden method must be used when overwriting, and the parameters and return type of the original method must not be modified.

procedure Create(AOwner: TComponent); override;

//Override is mostly used for inheritance, and the method of the parent class is overwritten with the subclass.

//If the method of the parent class is not declared with Virtual or Dynamic,

//Or if you need to modify the parameters, you must use the Reintroduce keyword to cover it.
