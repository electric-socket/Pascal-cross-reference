PROGRAM pcross(input, output) ;
(*$N+       ***********
PCROSS is a cross-referencing program for PASCAL source files,
useful also to reformat programs (indentation, upper-lower case)
and to find omitted or excessive BEGINS and ENDS.

<INPUT AND OUTPUT>
INPUT:
-----
through the file OLDSOURCE, a PASCAL source program file.

OUTPUT:
------
through NEWSOURCE:
        a copy of your input file, unnumbered, prettyprinted
        (proper indentation according to the statement nesting,
         newline on standard places in the program, management of upper
         and lower case according to the list of reserved words, etc.)

and trough  CROSSLIST:
        (a) a prettyprinted version of the program, showing in the left
            margin the relations between BEGIN..END pairs,THEN..ELSE
            pairs, etc.
        (b) a cross reference of all the identifiers
        (c) a report of procedure and function declaration nesting.

By default, PCROSS will change all reserved words and strings to upper
case, comments and everything else to lower case. There are switches
available to change this condition.
<HOW TO USE IT>
You can:
        (a) use the /CREF switch when @EXECUTEing your program
             or calling @PASCAL, or
        (b) call it directly by typing @PCROSS.

In the first case, PCROSS will be called immediately after compilation;
    You will have to type the file names, though. We are working to fix
    that detail soon. Two sample calls are:

        @pcross                         AND     @exec myprog/cref
        OLDSOURCE= myprog.pas/nocross             (*COMPILER STUFF HERE*)
        NEWSOURCE= myprog.pas                   OLDSOURCE= myprog.pas
        CROSSLIST=                              NEWSOURCE=
                                                CROSSLIST=

The left one calls it directly. The effect is the prettyprinting of the
program file itself. The right one is a call through the compiler, which
will use the default options.

The program parameters all have dafault values, but they can be modified
if desired, by the use of switches. See the subtopic SWITCHES.
See the subtopic SWITCHES.
<SWITCHES>
                                        Brackets indicate optional.
                                        <n> stands for an integer number.
                                        <L> stands for a letter.

   Switch          Meaning                                      Default.

        FILES.
                 <n> is the sum of:
                       1   source program listing
                       2   listing of identifiers
                       4   listing of proc-func
                           declaration nesting.
                       8   listing of proc-func call nesting.

        STATEMENT FORMAT
                  begin..end block is indented n spaces further.
                if it is there, the block will not be indented,
                  but the begin and end statements will be
                  exdented n spaces.                           0

        UPPER AND LOWER CASE
                       note: the possible values for <l> are:
                               u means upper case
                               l means lower case.

<READING THE OUTPUT>

The cross-reference file CROSSLIST contains 4 parts:

1. THE PROGRAM LISTING:
        the letters and numbers in the left margin indicate the presence
        of reserved words which have to match. (BEGIN-END, etc.) The two
        words that match accorde with the scope rules will have the
        same number. The first one (e. g., BEGIN) will appear at left, and
        the second one (e.g., END) at right, inside the margin. The meaning
        of the letters is:
                B  Begin        E end
                I  If           T  Then         S Else
                L  Loop         X  Exit         E End
                C  Case         E  End
                R  Repeat       U  Until

2. THE CROSS REFERENCE LISTING OF IDENTIFIERS:
        It is ordered alphabetically. For each identifier it contains:
            a. A 'P' or 'F' if it is a procedure or function, respectively.
            b. The name of the identifier, up to 10 symbols.
            c. The line numbers in which it occur. Those lines in which
                  it is declared are marked with a D; those in which it
                  occurs more than once are marked with an M (Multiple).

3. THE NESTING OF PROCEDURE-FUNCTION DECLARATION:
        It describes the static links. The scope is shown by indentation.
        Each line describes a procedure or function and contains:
            a. The name.
            b. an (M), (P) or (F) if it is the main program, a procedure
                  or a function, respectively.
            c. If there are more than one procedure-function with the same
                  name (in different scopes, which is perfectly valid, but
                  a horrible thing to do), a D  (for DOUBLE) appears next,
                  and the rest of the information in this and the next part
                  of the listing contains data on both (or all of them, if
                  there are more than one.).
            d. If it is an external procedure, an E will appear next.
            e. The line number where the header appeared.
            f. The line number of the BEGIN statement.
            g. The line number of the END statement.

4. THE NESTING OF PROCEDURE-FUNCTION CALLS:
        It describes the dynamic links. Calling depth is indicated by
        indenting. The format of each line is the same as in the previous
        report, except for the following:
            a. Lines are numbered.
            b. A procedure can be called from more than one place. To avoid
                repeating the list of proc-funcs called by it,an asterisk
                is printed after the name to indicate that it has already
                been 'described'. Instead of the line numbers for its
                appearence in the program, that for its appearence in this
                part of the listing is given, so that you can refer to it.
