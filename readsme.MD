# Crossref - Pascal Cross Reference
I've decided to document the program "as it happens."  That means I'm going to explain what I am doing and why.
I've decided to develop the program in "accretion mode." (Accretion is how an oyster builds a pearl, by coating a grain of sand and adding more coating.) I plan to build it a   piece at a time, adding functionality to the program a little at a time, o I don't end up with a huge mess that's impossible to fix, understand or update.

So, what's the minimum it should do? Read a file, writing it, unchanged, to a listing file. This will confirm the basic functionality works.
## Version 0.01 - Copy File
Working on it.
