Cross reference points
Function and procedure list
Unit table,
   Uses
   Usedby has pointer to another table
   need to separate used by / used table from unit table.
   Might have it point to unit entry same as for proc/func
   might have variant record, something like
    useusedbytable: record =
      name: unicodestring;
      case kind: usagetype of
           procusedby: usedptr;
           procuses: useptr
           unitusedby: usedptr
           unituses: useptr;
       end;

    defined . declared : boolean // defined in interface or by forward
                                 // in implementation
                 declared is where its signature starts
                 begin and end lines
    main - true if in main program (instead of unit)
    above_the_line: defined in interface, i.e. public


   class is similar to record, has no block warning like record
   class named by class(x) means this is derived from class x
   scalars or base items
   , records   block
   , fields    items in record
