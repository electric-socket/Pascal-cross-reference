// XD Pascal for Windows (XPDW) - a 32-bit compiler
// Copyright 2020 Paul Robnson

// Latest upgrade by Paul Robinson: New Years Eve; Thursday, December 31, 2020

// VERSION 0.15 {.0}

// program to auomatically update the revision level
// of the compiler and to create a batch file to
// update all files in local GIT repository

(* I use a two-stage process; I start with the master
   repository on Github. This is cloned to a pristine
   first-stage repository on R:\ (which is SUBST to
   the actual drive and folder where XDPW is housed).
   I copy that first-stage repository to another
   work directory where I do editing. I use the file
   C.BAT allowing me to just type C (and RETURN) to
   recompile. C runs this program to increase the
   revision number in COMMON.PAS by 1, rewrite
   COMMON.PAS with the new update number, then this
   program creates BK.BAT which updates the first-stage
   repository.

   If the first compile works, it means there are no
   syntax errors in the current revision. If so, that
   compiler binary, SOURCE\XDPW.EXE is moved over from
   the SOURCE subdirectory as X.EXE. Then, the compiler
   is recompiled again, this time with itself to do two
   things: (1) confirm it has no errors, and (2) to update
   the revision level of the compiler. If the recompile
   is successful, then all files are automatically copied
   back to the first stage repository on R:, and a commit
   is made. This way, only revisions that work are pushed
   to the first stage, avoiding the problem of making a
   commit of a compiler with syntax errors or one which
   does not work (at least to the extent of actually being
   able to successfully compile itself.)

    { Taking a hint from the compiler, I don't read or write files
      one byte at a time. I request a block of memory big enough to
      hold the entire file, read it all into that, then go through
      the cached memory copy a byte at a time. I write to the memory
      file a byte at a time, then rewrite the copy back as a single
      block write. *Much* faster. }
